deepcopy contents of list a to list b:

struct Node {

	int dataLen;
	struct Node *next;
};


a = {"abcd": 4}, {"efghij": 6], {"klmno": 5}

b = {"lmnop": 5}, {"qrs": 3}, {"tuvwxyz": 8}

after deepcopy b = {"abcde": 5}, {fgh": 3}, {"ijklmno": 7}
int deepCopy(struct Node *a, struct Node*b)
{
	// copy all data from a to a vector<string>
	// Then write it to be based on b->dataLen
